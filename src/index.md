A group of programmers that are passionate about our craft.

We have a different format from your usual technology user group. Here is our format:

- 0-3 Lightning talks (capped at 5 minutes each) - Anybody can have 5 minutes to talk about whatever topic they feel
  will be of interest to the group. You will be buzzed off at 5 minutes.
- ~30 min - Reading Discussion (usually a chapter or two from a book)
- ~60 min - Coding Exercise (we've done guided katas, randori, open coding of a problem, experiences... really anything
  as long as everyone is coding)
