Not your typical software meetup! This is an opportunity to learn from your peers via discussion and pair programming.
Bring your laptop as the last hour is a coding exercise.

- Reading Discussion (~30 min)
  - *This is Lean* Chapters 2 and 3 https://a.co/d/cd3vwtg
- Coding Exercise (~60 min)

[^1]: Lightning talks are capped at 5 minutes each. Anybody can have 5 minutes to talk about whatever topic they feel will
be of interest to the group. A buzzer will sound at 5 minutes.
